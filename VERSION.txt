V2.2.2a

 1. Parse and render seqs in the same thread
 2. SSH will block forever on exitting tab

v2.2.3a

 1. I place all render seqs to parser thread, it's more complicated than before
 2. Upp/SSH process data in GUI-thread, so we should make sure all works were completed before
    the GUI resources were released.
