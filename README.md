# comxd

Another serial port tool

This is my practice work with [U++](http://www.ultimatepp.org/).

## ECMA-48

This is a kind of specification which defines control functions and their coded representations for use in a 7-bit code, an extended 7-bit code, an 8-bit code or an extended 8-bit code.

It says we do not have to support all features defined in ECMA-048. Yes, it's true. If we support all of them, it must be a complicated work I've never experienced.

## vt100

- Features/Sequences were ignored
  
  - Auto wrap. We have unlimited line width, I like it, so we ignore line wrap
  - VT52 control sequences.
  - DECLL
  - DECTST
  - MC
  - Printer. We response "No printer"

- Keys were supported
  
  - Control + ...
  
  - Direction keys
  
  - HOME

## ANSI

- All sequences were recognized
- ANSI Extended charset

## vt220

- charsets

## vt320

- charsets

## vt420

- most of charsets

## vt520

- most of charsets
- All sequences were recognized (well, most of...)
- DCS OSC, .etc were ignored
- We do not process most of sequences

## xterm

- most of charsets
- Ignore a lost of sequences

# Summary

- It's a real compicated work to implent a virtual terminal
- No Sixelï¼ŒNo ReGIS
- Enough for our applications
- Will add more features if we need
